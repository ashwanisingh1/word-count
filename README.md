<b>Reactjs-</b>
In react we have 2 component where one is for the searchbox(search_bar.js) and the other is for list items(list.js) which are being rendered on the same page.

The api fetch happens when we write a number in the search box which takes data from the express api and the data which comes in json format is rendered on the web page.

<b>Express-</b>
There is a express api which returns json data for a query with a number i.e n most occurring words.

<b>Api call -</b>

/api/:id

where id is the number for query.
